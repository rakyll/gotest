gotest comes with many colors! Configure the color of the output by setting the following environment variables:

- `GOTEST_FAIL`
- `GOTEST_PASS`
- `GOTEST_SKIP`

Alternatively you can use a single environment supporting a list of colors, in the order: fail, pass, and skip.

```
$ GOTEST_PALETTE="magenta,white"
```

The output will have magenta for failed cases, white for success.
Available colors: black, hiblack, red, hired, green, higreen, yellow, hiyellow, blue, hiblue, magenta, himagenta, cyan, hicyan, white, hiwhite.

Do note that the individually set environment variables take precedence over the palette variable

For the setting:

```
$ GOTEST_PASS="hiblue" GOTEST_PALETTE="magenta,white"
```

The output will have magenta for failed cases, hiblue for success.
